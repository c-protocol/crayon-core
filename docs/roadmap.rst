Roadmap
#######

The roll-out of the Crayon Protocol will follow these broad stages and timeframes. The team reserves the right to accelerate the execution of some of the stages or target additional chains for roll-outs or roll out additional desks. Note that after the ``Governor`` smart contract is deployed all decisions related to all desks will be taken by ``XCRAY`` holders.

Milestones
==========

The most important milestones on our current roadmap are the deployment of the ``Governor`` smart contract which will transfer control of the Crayon Protocol desks to ``XCRAY`` holders and the support of RWA collateral on specialized desks in partnership with RWA issuers. The deployment of RWA support will be part of a v2 rollout of Crayon.

* **2023Q2**: Limited roll-out on Arbitrum. Start ``XCRAY`` token distribution to Arbitrum desks users.
* **2025**: 

    * Liquidity bootstrapping and ``XCRAY`` token sale
    * Crayon decentralized governance launch through ``Governor`` smart contract deployment.

* **2025**:

    * Crayon v2 with, in particular, support for RWA collateral.
